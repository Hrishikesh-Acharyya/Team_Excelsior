1. Will be using whisper to take audio from frontend and process it in the backend. Whisper Ai has better language detection ability and more language support and better features
2. Will be using llama together.ai to structure data
3. Using django framwework for backend
4. Using django rest framework to manage API calls
5. Using postgreSQL for database
   
## 6 !!!!! Only created the necessary config files for backend. Nothing has been implemented yet. To run code in your environment, in the terminal, run 'python install -r requirements.txt'.  check the .env.example file, copy it and paste values according to your system.
